  #   Nicolas: I want to define that there are different workplaces where an operator can work from. This will then be linked to the % of exposure that an operator can take. For example we often use “workstation” ; “assistance” ; “in a airlock” or even “in the building”, which corresponds to where operators are, there aren’t always taking 100% of the dose rate at the workstation. I have to define that because there is only one calculated dose rate, from where the avatar is standing.
